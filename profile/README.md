## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

* This organization is dedicated to my minecraft coding activity.
* In here I will store libraries used inside my plugins and even parts of the source code associated with them.
* If you think you have found a bug in any of the open source repositories, feel free to create a pull request or report it on discord.
* If you want to add new features to them instead, please contact me beforehand on discord.

### Discord

You can contact me directly via `qking12` or through my discord server for minecraft: https://discord.gg/F6PHpunGeN
